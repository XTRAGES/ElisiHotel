## üõ†Ô∏è TO RESTORE FUNCTIONALITY

To make this system fully functional, a developer would need to implement:

1. **Database Connection Logic** in `config.php`
2. **Authentication System** with secure password handling
3. **CRUD Operations** for all entities (rooms, staff, users)
4. **Session Management** and security measures
5. **Data Validation** and sanitization
6. **Error Handling** and user feedback
7. **Admin Authorization** and role-based access control

## üìã ESTIMATED DEVELOPMENT TIME

To complete the removed functionality:
- **Junior Developer:** 40-60 hours
- **Mid-level Developer:** 25-35 hours  
- **Senior Developer:** 15-25 hours

## üéØ PURPOSE OF THIS PROTECTION

This modification ensures that:
- The project demonstrates the developer's capabilities
- Core business logic remains protected intellectual property
- Unauthorized completion is significantly hindered
- The codebase serves as a portfolio piece rather than a complete solution
